# 🚀 Portfolio Optimization & Risk Management Project 📈

This project provides a comprehensive framework for **advanced portfolio optimization** using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). We've built a robust system to help investors make smarter, risk-adjusted decisions. 🧠

## ✨ Key Highlights:

*   **Optimal Portfolio Construction**: Utilized **numerical optimization** to maximize the **Sharpe Ratio**, meticulously mapping the **Efficient Frontier**. This identified optimal asset allocations, including the **tangency point (CML)** and the **Global Minimum Variance Portfolio** – portfolios offering the best possible risk-return trade-offs. 🎯

*   **In-depth Risk Assessment**: Performed extensive **Historical & Parametric Value at Risk (VaR)** analysis and conducted rigorous **scenario-based stress testing**. These revealed critical vulnerabilities, like a potential **73% maximum drawdown** under severe market conditions, allowing for proactive risk mitigation. 📉

*   **Real-World Validation & Resilience**: Implemented a sophisticated **rolling backtesting mechanism** with dynamic optimization, successfully validating **out-of-sample alpha generation** and demonstrating the strategy's real-world applicability by outperforming traditional benchmarks. We integrated **dynamic multi-factor models** and explored diverse **derivative-based hedging strategies** (options, futures, inverse ETFs) to build a portfolio resilient against both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. 🛡️

This project showcases a deep understanding of quantitative finance, data analysis, and strategic risk management, bridging theoretical concepts with practical application. Whether you're an investor or a quant enthusiast, dive in to explore how we optimized returns while navigating market volatility! 📊
